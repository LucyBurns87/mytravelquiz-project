Travel Quiz with 10 Questions 

Project 1 of my course to include the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript Functionality.

Overview 

This is an online quiz where users can answer multiple-choice options and navigation buttons (“next”, “previous”).  The code used to create the website shows the understanding of JavaScript HTML and CSS for structure and Styling.  At the end of the quiz users will receive a total score and a message of their performance.  

Features

The Website exists on one page only with multiple features visible to the user.  The design presents a structured layout with headers and navigation model. There is a set of instructions to follow with the Rules set out.  There is a “Start” button for the user to start the game. 

Once the quiz has started the buttons on the site will offer user feedback with on-hover animations and pointers. The user will get instant feedback in the change of colour for the correct answer.  The scores will be calculated and the user will receive the result.  There will also be a restart button.
